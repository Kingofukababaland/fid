    <p>
      I don&#39;t know how authentic this recipe is, but it&#39;s quick and delicious. You can make it lactose-free by substituting a dairy-free margarine (we like Earth&#39;s Balance) for the butter. (Unfortunately, butter is better.) This recipe serves 2.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        2 cans chopped clams (tuna-sized cans)
      </li>
      <li>
        1/2 head of garlic, chopped fine
      </li>
      <li>
        1 shallot, chopped fine
      </li>
      <li>
        2-3 T. butter (or margarine)
      </li>
      <li>
        1/2-3/4 c. dry white wine (like Sauvignon Blanc)
      </li>
      <li>
        1/2 lb. linguine
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Get the water boiling for the linguine. Generously salt the water so the pasta has flavor of its own.
      </li>
      <li>
        Open the cans of clams and use the lid to squeeze out the liquid into a 2-cup measuring cup. Set the clams aside You usually get about 1 1/2 cups of liquid. Add wine to the liquid until you have a total of 2 cups liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a high-sided, large skillet, saute the shallot in 2 T. butter until translucent. Add the garlic (the more the better) and saute until fragrant, but not brown (just under a minute).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the clam juice and wine to the shallots and garlic. Turn the heat to medium high until the mixture boils. Continue boiling until the liquid has reduced by half.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn down the heat and add the reserved clams. At roughly the same time, add the pasta to the water and cook until al dente. About 9 minutes later, the pasta should be done and the clams will be warmed through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste the clam sauce and add salt and pepper to taste. If you&#39;re using butter, add one last tablespoon or two to bind the sauce (if you&#39;re using margarine, don&#39;t bother).
      </li>
    </ol>
